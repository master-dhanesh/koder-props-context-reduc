1. Install dependencies of redux toolkit
2. Create folder "store" inside "src" folder
3. In "store" folder create "store.jsx" file
4. In "store.jsx" write the code to configureStore
5. In "main.jsx" wrap the <App /> with Provider and pass store prop as store
6. Create  new folder "reducers" in "store" folder and create a 
    slice(file) i.e. "productSlice.jsx"
7. code to createSlice and default export the slice.reducer
8. import the "productSlice" in "store.jsx" and pass it to the reducer
9. In order to access the store data in any react component we use 
    "useSelector(cb)" hook given by redux which is read-only
