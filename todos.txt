1. Install dependencies of redux toolkit
2. Create folder "store" inside "src" folder
3. In "store" folder create "store.jsx" file
4. In "store.jsx" write the code to configureStore
5. In "main.jsx" wrap the <App /> with Provider and pass store prop as store
6. Create  new folder "reducers" in "store" folder and create a 
    slice(file) i.e. "productSlice.jsx"
7. code to createSlice and default export the slice.reducer
8. import the "productSlice" in "store.jsx" and pass it to the reducer
9. In order to access the store data in any react component we use 
    "useSelector(cb)" hook given by redux which is read-only    
10. to make the create functionality create a form in "App.jsx" and make "AddHandler" function (holds the newProduct object)
11. In "productSlice.jsx" create an Action "add" which has the code to add new product in initialState and const export the "productSlice.actions"
12. In "App.jsx" import add and dispatch the new product
